# themed-news-search

To integrate this into the main branch, we can follow a structured task-based approach. Here’s a suggested task structure and functionalities from a user case perspective:

### Task Structure

1. **User Query Analysis**
   - Task: Implement NLP to parse and understand user queries.
   - Task: Identify key themes and topics from the query.

2. **Contextual Theme Identification**
   - Task: Create a hierarchical structure for themes.
   - Task: Develop algorithms to match user queries with the most relevant themes and abstraction levels.

3. **News Source Integration**
   - Task: Integrate APIs to fetch news articles from multiple sources.
   - Task: Ensure regular updates to retrieve current news.

4. **Relevance Scoring and Sorting**
   - Task: Develop algorithms to score articles based on relevance.
   - Task: Implement sorting mechanisms to display the most relevant articles first.

5. **Meta-Contextual Layer**
   - Task: Implement summarization tools for quick insights.
   - Task: Provide contextual links to related articles, historical data, and background information.

6. **User Feedback Loop**
   - Task: Create mechanisms for users to rate the relevance and quality of articles.
   - Task: Implement adaptive learning to refine algorithms based on feedback.

7. **Frontend Development**
   - Task: Design and implement the search bar for user queries.
   - Task: Develop the main content area to display sorted articles.
   - Task: Implement filters and sorting options.
   - Task: Design the sidebar with categories and trending tags.
   - Task: Create the footer with further reading and contact information.
   - Task: Implement navigation for hierarchical themes.

### Suggested Functionalities from a User Case Perspective

1. **User Query Analysis**
   - Users enter their queries in a search bar.
   - The system uses NLP to parse the query and identify key themes and topics.

2. **Contextual Theme Identification**
   - The system maps the identified themes to a hierarchical structure.
   - Users can navigate through related topics by abstraction level.

3. **News Source Integration**
   - The system fetches news articles from various reputable sources based on the identified themes.

4. **Relevance Scoring and Sorting**
   - Articles are scored and sorted based on relevance to the user query.
   - Users see the most relevant articles first.

5. **Meta-Contextual Layer**
   - Articles are summarized for quick insights.
   - Users can access contextual links to related articles, historical data, and background information.

6. **User Feedback Loop**
   - Users can rate the relevance and quality of articles.
   - The system adapts and improves based on user feedback.

7. **Frontend Development**
   - A search bar for user queries.
   - A main content area displaying sorted articles.
   - Filters and sorting options for users to refine their search.
   - A sidebar with categories and trending tags.
   - A footer with further reading and contact information.
   - Navigation for hierarchical themes, allowing users to explore topics by abstraction level.
